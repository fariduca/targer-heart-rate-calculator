# target-heart-rate-calculator

This small GUI calculator calculates the maximum heart rate and heart rate range for a given age. 

According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years (http://bit.ly/AHATargetHeartRates). Your target heart rate is a range that is 50â€“85% of your maximum heart rate.

[Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]
